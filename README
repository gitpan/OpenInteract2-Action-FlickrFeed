README: OpenInteract2::Action::FlickrFeed
============================================

This is a simple OpenInteract2 action that retrieves the Atom feed for
a photostream and makes the data available to a template of your
choosing. It's only marginally more complicated than
OpenInteract2::Action::RSS (which it extends) because it parses each
feed entry into its component pieces, all of which are sent to the
template.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

CONFIGURATION

First, you need to register your type; in your conf/server.ini:

 [action_types]
 ...
 flickr = OpenInteract2::Action::FlickrFeed

In your conf/action.ini:

 [my_flickr]
 type         = flickr
 title        = My Flickr Photos
 feed_id      = 62037332@N99
 template     = myapp::flickr_feed
 cache_expire = 30m
 num_photos   = 4

Now you can deposit the results of your feed married to your template:

 [% OI.action_execute( 'my_flickr' ) %]
